# The OIDC claim to use as the entity-alias name for the entity-aliases

# bbcrd_vault_oidc_user_claim_to_entity_name_mapping.
#
# For standard claims provided by all OIDC providers, see

#
# 'sub' is officially the "best" choice since it is guaranteed to be unique,
# stable and consistent over time, but is typically an opaque UUID which is
# often never seen outside of the OIDC protocol.
#
# 'email' might also work since it is at least guaranteed to be unique at a
# point in time. The most serious issue is that email addresses could in
# principle be reused. As such, care must be taken to remove email addresses
# from Vault in a timely manner during the JML process.

# A dictionary mapping from OIDC claims (as selected by
# bbcrd_vault_oidc_user_claim_to_entity_name_mapping) to Vault entity names
# (i.e. users).
#
# You should, in some other step add policies or groups to the named entities
# to give them useful abilities.
#
# Users not enumerated here will still be able to successfully log in and be
# issued with a valid token. These tokens, however, will only be associated
# with an automatically-generated vault Entity (i.e. user) and thus not be
# granted any policies beyond the 'default' policy. If a user is subsequently
# added to this list, however, they will become correctly reassociated with the
# correct Vault entity.
#
# Removing an entry from this dictionary removes any existing associations
# between the OIDC user and Vault entity. When that user next authenticates,
# they will be associated with a new auto-generated identity without any of
# their previous policies.
#
# The default value generates a mapping based on data in
# bbcrd_vault_administrators. Specifically, the entity name will be the key
# in this dictionary and the OIDC claim value will come from the field named by
# bbcrd_vault_oidc_user_claim.
#
# For example, if bbcrd_vault_oidc_user_claim
# is 'email' and bbcrd_vault_administrators looks like:
#
#     bbcrd_vault_administrators:
#       jonathan:
#         email: jonathan.heathcote@bbc.co.uk
#         # ...
#       andrew:
#         email: andrew.bonney@bbc.co.uk
#         # ...
#       dummy_user:
#         # ... no email specified ...
#
# The resulting mapping would be:
#
#     bbcrd_vault_oidc_user_claim_to_entity_name_mapping:
#       jonathan.heathcote@bbc.co.uk: jonathan
#       andrew.bonney@bbc.co.uk: andrew
