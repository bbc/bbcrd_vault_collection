`bbcrd.vault.common_defaults` role
==================================

This role does nothing except set a number of default variables which are
common to many or all of the roles in this collection.

Other roles in this collection explicitly depend on this role (unless otherwise
noted) causing these defaults to be automatically pulled in.

See the [Ansible conventions for Vault cluster management playbooks and roles
documentation](../../docs/ansible_cluster_management_conventions.md) for more
information.
